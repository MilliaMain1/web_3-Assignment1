---
## Testing 
#### Notes
-  If you have knowledge of nix, you can use the `flake.nix` file, that contains a default script that will test all of the following links

- Render will suspend inactive applications and will wake them up upon a request. Though it says that is could take around a minute. I have found it to take much longer.  If this becomes an issue, feel free to reach out and I will move my application to be temporarily hosted somewhere else
